- INSPIRE!: 25 min (x2) (speed dating)

Eleven years ago we started a new Computer Science program at Marlborough
School, with a single coding class.  Since then, we have followed our students'
interests to create a curriculum that encourages students to create with code,
and to bring their code to the real world.  We have built the curriculum solely
on open source software and open educational resources.

In this session I will present specific ways where students can bring Computer
Science to other areas of campus, including History and Social Science,
Robotics, Engineering, Entrepreneurship, Academic Research, Performing Arts,
and Social Justice.  I will also describe the landscape of languages, tools,
and free resources for CS education.
